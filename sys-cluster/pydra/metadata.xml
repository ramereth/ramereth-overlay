	Pydra is a distributed and parallel computing framework for python. Pydra
	aims to provide an easy to use framework for writing and running
	parallelized programs for developers, and an easy to manage cluster for the
	administrators.

	some of the main features that are implemented or will be implemented in
	1.0:

	* Easily defined tasks - Clustering software is only as useful as the jobs
	  that can be written for it. To this end pydra hides parallelization code
	  and makes writing tasks simple.
	* Map-Reduce support - Map-Reduce is a  concept introduced by google. Pydra
	  currently supports most of the Map-Reduce concept. The only missing piece
	  is parallelizing the map function.
	* Network auto-discovery - To aide in setting up a cluster nodes will be
	  discoverable via the
	* Job queueing - Jobs will be started immediately if they can be, otherwise
	  Pydra will queue jobs automatically
	* Web based interface - Through the management interface the cluster can be
	  managed, and tasks can be run or
	* Central cluster configuration - Nodes can be configured and updated via
	  the management interface
    * History - Detailed history of jobs.
	* Fault tolerance - Things go wrong, pydra is designed to gracefully recover
	  when it happens.
	* security - Pydra remotely executes code, the controls for doing so are
	  tightly wrapped to prevent tampering with your cluster.

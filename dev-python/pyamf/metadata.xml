	PyAMF provides Action Message Format (AMF) support for  Python that is
	compatible with the  Adobe Flash Player. It includes integration with Python
	web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Twisted, SQLAlchemy and more.

	The  Adobe Integrated Runtime and  Adobe Flash Player use AMF to communicate
	between an application and a remote server. AMF encodes remote procedure
	calls (RPC) into a compact binary representation that can be transferred
	over HTTP/HTTPS or the  RTMP/RTMPS protocol. Objects and data values are
	serialized into this binary format, which increases performance, allowing
	applications to load data up to 10 times faster than with text-based formats
	such as XML or SOAP.

	AMF 3, the default serialization for ActionScript(TM) 3.0, provides various
	advantages over AMF0, which is used for ActionScript(TM) 1.0 and 2.0. AMF 3
	sends data over the network more efficiently than AMF 0. AMF 3 supports
	sending int and uint objects as integers and supports data types that are
	available only in ActionScript(TM) 3.0, such as ByteArray, ArrayCollection,
	ObjectProxy and IExternalizable.
